# CSC-460-project-1
Phase 1:
Using an Arduino Mega2560 to program a joystick which controls two servo motors mounted in a 
pan & tilt kit to aim a laser pointer at a light sensor then
display the status info on an LCD.

Phase 2:
Control a remote station (iRobot Roomba 600 robot) from a base station via bluetooth communication.
The base station consists of 2 joysticks, one to control Roomba movement and one to control the position
and functionality of a laser pointer, and an LCD to display status information.
